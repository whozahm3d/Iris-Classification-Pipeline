## 📄 Abstract

This project implements a complete, production-grade supervised learning pipeline
for multi-class data classification using the Iris benchmark dataset. It covers
every stage of the ML engineering lifecycle — from raw data ingestion with
source fallback logic, through exploratory analysis, preprocessing, model
training, cross-validation, statistical significance testing, and explainability
— culminating in a persisted sklearn Pipeline and a real-time interactive
prediction interface.

The project goes significantly beyond the DecodeLabs Project 2 specification.
Rather than training a single KNN classifier, it trains and rigorously compares
four algorithms (KNN, Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression) plus a soft-voting
ensemble, evaluates each across five metrics, runs stratified k-fold
cross-validation with paired t-test significance testing, and applies SHAP
explainability to the best model. All code is modular, documented, and organized
as a deployable Python package.

As a portfolio artifact, this notebook demonstrates mastery of the full
supervised learning workflow — data validation, feature scaling without leakage,
hyperparameter tuning, domain-aware evaluation, and experiment reproducibility —
skills that transfer directly to production ML engineering roles.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- **KNN does not scale** — inference is O(n × d) at prediction time. Unsuitable for datasets beyond ~100k rows without approximation methods like FAISS.
- **Iris is a benchmark, not a real problem** — near-perfect class separability (especially Setosa) is not representative of real-world noise, missing values, or class overlap.
- **No Bayesian hyperparameter search** — GridSearchCV covers a fixed param grid. Production pipelines would use Optuna or Ray Tune for smarter search.
- **Model not validated on external data** — all evaluation is in-distribution. A held-out external dataset would be needed to confirm generalization.

---

## 🚀 Future Work

- **Project 3 — Deep Learning & CNNs** — move from tabular classification to image classification using convolutional neural networks on a real image dataset.
- **Scalable inference** — replace KNN with a neural network classifier and serve via FastAPI REST endpoint for production deployment.
- **Proper experiment tracking** — integrate MLflow or Weights & Biases to replace the manual CSV logger with a full experiment management system.
- **AutoML comparison** — benchmark the manual pipeline against TPOT or H2O AutoML to quantify the value of human-guided feature engineering.
